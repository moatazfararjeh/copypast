As part of the Microsoft Dynamics 2013 official training material there are a couple of slides which I thought I would share.

If you ever want to change the SQL Server a deployment is using, you must change the config database and the organisation database.

On the computers running Microsoft Dynamics CRM, modify the registry value:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\MSCRM\configdb

Old Value

DataSource=SQLServer;InitialCatalog=MSCRM_CONFIG;Integrated Security=SSPI

New Value

DataSource=NewSQLServer;InitialCatalog=MSCRM_CONFIG;Integrated Security=SSPI

To move the organization database:

1.       Back up the organization database on the current SQL Server.
2.       Restore the database to the new SQL Server Cluster.

In Deployment Manager:

1.       Disable the organization.
2.       Edit the organization properties.
3.       Change the SQL Server name to that of the new SQL Server.
4.       Enable the organization.
